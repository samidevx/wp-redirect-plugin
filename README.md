# wp-redirect-plugin
wordpress plugin redirect after special time
A super easy way to automatically redirect a user to another page when viewing a post/page on your site.

Features :
* Works on pages and posts
* NO settings or configurations to deal with
* Define a URL to redirect the user to
* Define how many seconds to wait before re-directing the user.

Installation :
1. Upload 'wp-redirect-plugin.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Add the shortcode on the pages/posts that you want to redirect. Shortcodes should look like `[redirect url='http://mywebsite.com' sec='5']` where the url= part is the URL to redirect to, and sec= is the seconds to wait before redirecting the page.

4. Done!
